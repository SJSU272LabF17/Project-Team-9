<h2>Checklist for Software Development</h2>

<h3>1. Project Planning</h3>

<p>This is the first step in the software development process. The objective of this phase is to do the following:</p>

<b><p>a. Develop a Project Definition Document</b></p>

<p>The project definition document should include the following:</p>
<p><b>1. Identify stakeholders and their responsibilities</b></p>
<p><b>2. Assign project manager</b></p>>
<p><b>3. Provide tools and procedures for requirements management, project tracking, quality management, change management, risk management and release management</b></p>


<b><p>b. Develop a project management plan<p></b>

<p>The project management plan should include the following:</p>

<p><b>1. Define project schedule</b></p>

<p><b>2. Identify resource requirements and allocation</b></p>

<p><b>3. Include cost estimation and project budget plan</b></p>

<p><b>4. Schedule milestones and reviews</b></p>

<h3>2. Requirement Gathering and Analysis</h3>

<p>In this phase, the system inputs, processes, outputs and interfaces are defined in more detail. At the end of this phase, the system requirements will be defined at the functional level.Requirement analysis does not include the programs, files and data streams.</p>

<p>The following steps should be performed in this phase:</p>

<p>1. The Business Analyst develops a plan to carry out requirement gathering and analysis.</p>

<p>2. The Business Analyst must work carefully with the Subject Matter Experts(SME) to generate a <a href="http://www.ofnisystems.com/services/validation/functional-requirements/">Functional Requirements Document.</a></p>

<p>The Functional Requirements Document can include:</p>

<p><b>a. Entity-Relationship Diagrams</b></p>

<p><b>b. Activity Diagrams</b></p>

<p><b>c. Business Algorithms</b></p>

<p><b>d. Mock-ups</b></p>

<p>e. <a href="https://www.guru99.com/traceability-matrix.html"> Requirements Traceability Matrix</a></p>

<p>This phase ends when customer signs off the Functional Requirements Document.</p>

<h3>3. Design</h3>

<p>The objective of this phase is to transform the identified functional requirements into a detailed system architecture that is feasible, valuable and robust.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~lacher/courses/COP3331/sdd.html">System Design Document</a> is the outcome of the design phase of software development process.</p>

<p>The System Design Document includes the following:</p>

<p><b>a. Business Application Logic</b></p>

<p><b>b. User Interface Design</b></p>

<p><b>c. Database Design</b></p>

<p><b>d. Process Diagrams</b></p>

<p><b>e. Screen Layout Diagrams</b></p>

<h3>4. Coding</h3>

<p>The main objective of this phase is to transform the system architecture into a fully-functional working system that is consistent with technical and business requirements.</p>

<p>The coding phase includes the following steps:</p>

<p><b>a. Coding the software according to approved architecture by satisfying all industry standards</b></p>

<p><b>b. Perform unit testing</b></p>

<h3>5. Testing</h3>

<p>The objective of this phase is to perform system integration to ensure that the system fulfils all requirements with proper integration of all the system components.</p>

<p>The system may also require additional tests like below depending upon the complexity of the requirements:</p>

<p><b>a. Security Testing</b></p>

<p><b>b. Performance Testing</b></p>

<p><b>c. Stress Testing</b></p>

<p><b>d. Compatibility Testing</b></p>

<p><b>e. Regression Testing</b></p>

<p>It is necessary that all tests are completed as per the <a href="https://strongqa.com/qa-portal/testing-docs-templates/test-report">test report</a> and the test results are documented.</p>

<h3>6. Deployment</h3>

<p>The objective of the deployment phase is to install the system in production environment and to bring it into operation.</p>

<p>The system should fulfil the following criteria:</p>

<p><b>a. Satisfy the business needs and functional requirements</b></p>

<p><b>b. Give System Training</b></p>

<p><b>c. Adhere to all Service Level Agreements</b></p>

<p><b>d. Operates as per the criteria in the User Manual</b></p>

<p><b>e. Create an <a href="http://doit.maryland.gov/SDLC/Documents/SDLC%20Phase%2008%20Implementation%20Phase%20Multiple%20Hardware.pdf">Implementation Report</a></b></p>

<h3>7. Maintenance and Support Phase</h3>

<p><a href="https://eternalsunshineoftheismind.wordpress.com/2013/03/10/sdlc-phase-5-maintenance/">Maintenance and Support</a> Phase includes the following:</p>

<p><b>a. Post-Implementation Debugging</b></p>

<p><b>b. System corrections, additions, changes and upgrades to ensure that the system meets business requirements.</b></p>

<p><b>c. Keep system live</b></p>

<p><b>d. Provide user support via helpdesk</b></p>
