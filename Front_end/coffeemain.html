2. What will your signature drink be?<br>
3. What will your signature snack or food offering be?<br>
4. What will your customers get excited about?<br>

6. What menu options can you provide that is ultimately going to keep them coming back again and again?<br>
7. What will be the cost of each item?<br>

While you can search for a location independently, many take the help of a broker to do so. However, regardless of your decision,do consider the following points:</p>
